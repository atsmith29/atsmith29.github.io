      <h2>Smith Family Cycling Tradition</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up, cycling was always part of our life. My father was an avid cyclist and cycle commuter. We would often take family cycling trips, including a trip to Moab, Utah, when I was 14. Growing up in Madison’s rich cycling community, and living on the Lake Monona bike loop, it was easy to fall in love with it.

      <h2>Rebuilding, Riding, and Reconnecting</h2>
      <p>In my early adulthood, my friends and I would often fix up old bikes together. That DIY spirit stuck with me. In 2014, I got my Trek FX and began seriously cycling again.</p>
      <p>During the pandemic, biking became a lifeline. My friends and I would take on long rides together; my personal record is 88 miles in a single day.</p>

      <h2>2025: Oceanus & New Goals</h2>
      <p>In 2025, I’ve been aiming to ride as often as possible. Alongside other lifestyle changes, cycling has helped me lose weight and improve my health.</p>
      <p>For my 40th birthday, I gifted myself a Trek Checkpoint and named it <strong>Oceanus</strong>, as I was studying Greek literature audiobooks while breaking in the bike.</p>
