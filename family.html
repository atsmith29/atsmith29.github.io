  <h1>Family & Roots</h1>
<h2>Where I Come From</h2>

<p>My family is at the core of who I am. I am from Monona, a suburb of Madison, Wisconsin, where I still live with my family today. I was born on October 2nd, 1985, to Ken and Roberta Smith, two UW graduates who met at a blues show at The Crystal Corner bar. I have a twin brother, Nathan, and a late elder sister, Charlotte. I have two children, Luna, age 8, and Roman, age 16. I met my wife, Jessica, in 2012, and we married in 2015. We recently celebrated 10 years of marriage.
