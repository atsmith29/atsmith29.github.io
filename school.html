  <h1>My Education Journey</h1>

  <p>
    I started my return to college in 2018 at Madison College (MATC), while working full time and raising my family. 
    It took years of persistence, but I proudly earned my Associate’s Degree in 2023 alongside my wife Jessica.

    In Spring 2025, I transferred to the University of Wisconsin–Madison to pursue a degree in Information Science, with plans to add the Computer Science certificate.
    I'm especially excited to blend my lifelong passions for technology, music, and liberal arts into something meaningful. I’m hoping to use my skills to fight oppression in my community and beyond.

  <p>
    The following semester, Jessica also transferred into UW–Madison in the Health Promotion and Health Equity major in the School of Education. 
    We are excited to be together at school again, continuing our adventures in education hand in hand.

  <p>
    As a child growing up around Madison, I dreamed of attending UW–Madison. I come from a family of Badgers, with deep roots in the campus community.
    Getting accepted was more than just a milestone it was a dream that was lost and found again before being realized. 
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey hasn’t been easy. I’m a dyslexic learner and a non-traditional student. But I’ve built the study habits, support systems, and creative mindset to thrive. I’m enjoying the journey and I hope I can make a difference in my community with my degree.
