    <h1>Music</h1>

    <p>I’ve been obsessed with rock music from a young age. I developed a passion for consuming as well as playing music. I learned how to play guitar, bass, and drums. I like to say, everything I know about playing rock music I learned in the school orchestra, where I played cello. I keep a music room in my basement and love to play with family and friends any chance I get.  </p>

      <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
      <p>I’m hoping to start a new project as a creative outlet. It can be busy to find time while busy with school, work and family. I’ve been trying to improve my vocal skills, by having regular karaoke nights with my family, as well as in public form time to time. I would like to start a hardcore band that confronts rising fascism and authoritarianism through music.</p>

      <h2>Live Shows & Shared Joy</h2>
      <p>My wife and I love going to shows together. It's a big part of how we unwind, connect with the scene, and discover new music. From local dive bars to festival pits, we’ve danced, shouted, and sweat our way through hundreds of unforgettable sets.</p>
